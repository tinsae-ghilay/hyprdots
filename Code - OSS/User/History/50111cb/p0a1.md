## My Set up
Here are my hyprland + waybar config files.

I start by partitioning, formatting disks mounting them, enabling multilib on live iso and connecting to internet, after that
i curl the starting script with 

```bash

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinsae-ghilay/hyprdots/refs/heads/master/arch-install.sh -o installscript.sh

```
The above info is for me. If by any chance some one finds this and wants to use it for a fast install of their system, the prompts are straight forward.

1. Just asking if the script should be run. if multilib is not enabled it will fail after a bit. so uncomment multilib in `/etc/pacman.conf` (you may probably know this but "using vim or nano")

2. will ask for a keyboard layout, this layout should be available in the list of available input layouts. this can be obtained using the command `localectl list-keymaps`. for example this lists the following for German 
```bash
$ localectl list-keymaps

de   # this is generay quertz keyboard
de-latin1 # German with dead keys
de-latin1-nodeadkeys # german with no deadkeys -> what I want
de-mobii
de_CH-latin1 # swiss german
de_alt_UTF-8
``` 

so when it asks for keymap i type `de-latin1-nodeadkeys`

> ## *WARNING!!!* 
> for now if this is given a wring value, script will fail. so input carefully

## Notice.

the default system language is english UK as that is what I am using and I didnt bother add a prompt for this. this may be changed as per wish

```bash
# replace 'en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8' with the desired locale 
# example for US english it'd be en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
echo "en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8" > /etc/locale.gen 
locale-gen
```
3. should there be root password?
I prefer no, as its described as a security measure in Arch [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Security). If needed, putting y in allows setting root password.
4. Then there is timezone. The syntax would be Region/City, example `America/Argentina/Mendoza`, `Africa/Asmara` or `Europe/Vienna`. Timezones should be available in the list that can be viewed with 
```bash
$ timedatectl list-timezones
```

5. Then there is the Host name, any name youd identify your PC or Laptop with

6. User name and password setup
7. Prompt for installing Nvidia proprietary drivers. This assumes that there is an intel integrated GPU already (as is the case for me) and the system will run Hybrid GPU. so if the machine has an added Nvidia GPU select y, else n. if y is selected, drivers will be installed and pacman.hook and Nvidia rules added. in addition to Nvidia drivers, nvidia-utils, lib32-nvidia-utils nvidia-settings an nvidia-prime (for Prime offloading) will be installed
8. Finally, it will ask for a reboot or stay in chroot, do further configuration ..etc. 

## How it looks.
